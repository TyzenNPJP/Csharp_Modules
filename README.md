1) Inheritance: Create a base class Vehicle with properties Make, Model, and Year. Create two derived classes Car and Truck that inherit from Vehicle. Add properties engine cylinders and odometer to Car and Truck, respectively. Create an instance of each derived class and set their properties. Print the values of the properties to the console.

2) Encapsulation: Create a class BankAccount with properties Balance and AccountNumber. Create methods Deposit() and Withdraw() that modify the Balance property. Make the Balance property read-only. Add a property InterestRate that is set to 0.05 by default. Create a method CalculateInterest() that calculates the interest on the account balance. Create an instance of the BankAccount class and call its Deposit(), Withdraw(), and CalculateInterest() methods.

3) Abstraction: Create an abstract class Animal with a method MakeSound(). Create two derived classes Dog and Cat that inherit from Animal. Implement the MakeSound() method in each derived class to make a different sound. Create an instance of each derived class and call their MakeSound() methods.

4) Polymorphism: Create a class Shape with a method Draw(). Create two derived classes Circle and Rectangle that inherit from Shape. Override the Draw() method in each derived class to draw a different shape. Create an array of Shape objects that contains one instance of each derived class. Call the Draw() method on each object in the array.

5) Abstraction: Create an abstract class Vehicle with a method Drive(). Create two derived classes Car and Motorcycle that inherit from Vehicle. Implement the Drive() method in each derived class to drive the vehicle. Create an instance of each derived class and call their Drive() methods.

6) Inheritance: Create a base class Person with properties Name and Age. Create a derived class Employee that inherits from Person and has properties Salary and HireDate. Create an instance of the Employee class and set its properties. Print the values of the properties to the console.

7) Encapsulation: Create a class Student with properties Name, GPA, and Major. Create a method GetLetterGrade() that returns the letter grade based on the GPA property. Make the GPA property read-only. Create an instance of the Student class and call its GetLetterGrade() method.

8) Interfaces: Create an interface IShape with methods GetArea() and GetPerimeter(). Create two classes Circle and Rectangle that implement the IShape interface. Implement the GetArea() and GetPerimeter() methods in each class to calculate the area and perimeter of the shape. Create an instance of each class and call their GetArea() and GetPerimeter() methods.
